Image Hotspot Property Editor for Umbraco 7
===========================================

This is an attempt to provide similar functionality to what 
was previously available with the “uComponents ImagePoint” 
data type in Umbraco, versions 4 and 6.

This one's just called “Image Hotspot” because that's what 
our clients call it when they ask for this kind of thing :-)

**PLEASE NOTE:** This may not at all be production ready for 
your particular use but it served our needs at the time.
